I architect production-grade cloud platforms end-to-end using Terraform as the single source of truth for infrastructure, provisioning everything from IAM roles and least-privilege policies to fully automated compute, networking, and deployment layers. I design scalable application environments across Laravel, React, Next.js, and Django stacks using services such as Elastic Beanstalk for managed orchestration, Amplify for optimized frontend delivery, and Auto Scaling Groups backed by EBS/EFS storage to ensure elasticity and fault tolerance under load. My CI/CD pipelines integrate version control, automated testing, and deployment workflows to deliver zero-downtime releases while maintaining strict reliability standards. For data architecture, I implement secure, highly available RDS database clusters with optimized connection handling and Redis caching layers to reduce latency and improve throughput for high-traffic systems. Every environment is reproducible, auditable, and disposable — allowing me to spin up full production-equivalent infrastructures on demand and cleanly tear them down using Terraform destroy when testing, scaling, or migrating architectures, ensuring cost efficiency, consistency, and operational excellence.
